The Color Palette Generator is a visually appealing and interactive web application that allows users to generate random color palettes with a single click. It provides a seamless experience for users to explore and copy the generated color codes to their clipboard.


## 🌟 Features

- **Random Color Generation**: Users can click the "Generate" button to create a new set of four random colors.
- **Hex Code Display**: Hovering over any of the generated colors displays the corresponding hexadecimal color code.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Clicking on the hexadecimal color code copies it to the user's clipboard, accompanied by a "Copied to Clipboard" toast notification.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid UI development and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript for handling the logic and interactivity of the application.
- **Clipboard API**: A built-in JavaScript API used for copying text to the clipboard.
- **Toastify.js**: A lightweight and customizable toast notification library.


## Learnings
During the development of this project, I learned about the **Clipboard API**, a built-in JavaScript library that provides an easy way to copy text to the user's clipboard. The `writeText()` method of the Clipboard API was particularly useful for implementing the "Copy to Clipboard" functionality in this application.


## 📋 Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js and npm (for local development)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
